# Globify in React

## To have in mind
Before using the app you're required to go to src/auth/ and use the config.template.js as the template configuration file for your application. In this you'll be required to copy the Public and Secret ID for the Spotify application from spotify dashboard ``http://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/applications/``.
Also you'll need to update your redirect URL as the one you defined in the App. You should be able to use any URL you want.
